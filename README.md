# yarkinatac.github.io

Here is my Midterm project for the SE3355. I used to github pages for the deploy the my project and [my project](https://getbootstrap.com/(https://yarkinatac.github.io/)

The project contains HTML, CSS and Javascript files. I used Bootstrap [here is the link](https://getbootstrap.com/)

I created the api from the website mocky.io. The api contains 10 companies and 10 subjects.

index.html file contains the backbone of the webpage.

submitform.html is the page you get directed to when the information you fill in the form is correct.

styles.css contains the styling of the webpage. It has the code that makes website responsive.

app.js contains the e-mail and phone number validations and also fetch the data from the api, accessing companies and subjects name.

Note: The information taken from API takes a little long to load so you may need to wait for some time.
